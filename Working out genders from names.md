# Working out genders from names

Used the program `gender.c` by JÃ¶rg Michael, which I found from an article [here](https://www.heise.de/ct/ftp/07/17/182/). The dataset collected for this program is also used in other name-to-gender programs including Python's [sexmachine](https://github.com/ferhatelmas/sexmachine) and [genderreader](https://github.com/cstuder/genderReader) in PHP.
